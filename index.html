            <blockquote>
              <p>While the history of Latin and Greek texts as well as Hebrew Bibles in Colonial America and Mexico appearing in the early libraries of America is well documented, what lacks documentation are the other Hebraic texts that shared the shelves with the Hebrew Bibles and Latin and Greek texts that are known to have deeply influenced early American political, cultural, economic, and scientific thought. This project aims to explore the Hebraic texts which were present in the libraries of Colonial America and Mexico. Specifically, we wish to discover the libraries that held volumes of Hebraic texts in the Atlantic World and create datasets of the specific library editions of these volumes. From these datasets we hope to create visualizations that may help to show patterns in the data about the Hebraic texts in the libraries of the Atlantic World.</p>
